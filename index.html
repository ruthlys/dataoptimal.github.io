<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I am a microbial ecologist & data scientist in the making.
  At the moment, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow between the National Institute of Scientific Research (INRS)
  and the data analytics & visualization company <a href="https://plotly.com/">Plotly</a>.
  My research combines Omic technologies with data visualization tools
  like <a href="https://medium.com/plotly/announcing-dash-for-r-82dce99bae13">Dash for R</a> to
  study microbes that can help plants withstand drought and other environmental stressors. </p>

<p>I conducted my graduate studies in Biotechnology at the Technical University of Graz, Austria where I developed
   microbial consortia as sustainable alternative to pesticides together with
   Egyptâ€™s first organic agricultural organization SEKEM. I then moved to the Netherlands for my PhD studies at the Netherlands
   Institute of Ecology & Wageningen University. Here, I studied at the volatile language between
   microorganisms in the context of plant health.</p>

<p>Apart from dealing with microbes and data, I am passionate about bridging arts & science and making science more
  inclusive and accessible for which I have been active in organization including
  <a href="https://500womenscientists.org/">500 Women Scientists</a>, the <a href="https://qcbs.ca/">Quebec Center for
    Biodiversity Science (QCBS)</a> and the <a href="https://www.isme-microbes.org/">International Society for Microbial Ecology (ISME)
    </a>.</p>
