I am a microbial ecologist with a passion for data science. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow between the National Institute of Scientific Research (INRS) and the data analytics & visualization company [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) based in Montr√©al, Canada. My research aims at finding microbial solutions to combat drought in agriculture. For this I am combining Omic technologies with interactive data visualization tools in [Dash for R](https://medium.com/plotly/announcing-dash-for-r-82dce99bae13) and Python.
