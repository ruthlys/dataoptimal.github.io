<p>I am a microbial ecologist & data scientist in the making.
  At the moment, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow between the National Institute of Scientific Research (INRS)
  and the data analytics & visualization company <a href="https://plotly.com/">Plotly</a> in Montréal, Canada.
  My research combines Omic technologies with data visualization tools,
  like <a href="https://medium.com/plotly/announcing-dash-for-r-82dce99bae13">Dash for R</a> to
  study <a href="https://theconversation.com/microbial-aromas-might-save-crops-from-drought-103960">microbes that
    can help plants withstand drought</a>.</p>

<p>I conducted my graduate studies in Biotechnology at the Technical University of Graz, Austria where I developed
   microbial consortia as sustainable alternative to pesticides together with
   Egypt’s first organic agricultural organization SEKEM. I then moved to the Netherlands for my PhD studies at the Netherlands
   Institute of Ecology & Wageningen University where I studied the
   <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/04/170413190718.htm">volatile language between
   microorganisms in the context of plant health</a>. </p>

<p>Apart from dealing with microbes and data, I am passionate about bridging <a href="https://www.sciartmagazine.com/the-art-of-microbial-communication.html">arts & science</a> and making science more
  inclusive and accessible for which I have been active in organization including
  <a href="https://500womenscientists.org/">500 Women Scientists</a>, the <a href="https://qcbs.ca/">Quebec Center for
    Biodiversity Science (QCBS)</a> and the <a href="https://www.isme-microbes.org/">International Society for Microbial Ecology (ISME)
    </a>.</p>
