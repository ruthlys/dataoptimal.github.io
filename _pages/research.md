I am intrigued by the how microbes interact and communicate with each other and their environment. One such way stems from [volatile compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatiles). They're called volatile because they are easily released into the air by soil microbes or plants and are perceived by a variety of organisms, including us humans. You may have heard of geosmin, the probably most famous volatile compound that has a characteristic earthy, fresh smell and is produced by soil-dwelling bacteria when rain hits dry soil. It looks like this:

You may wonder what's so interesting about these volatiles. They have a variety of important ecosystem functions, like protecting plants from pathogens and supporting their growth and immune system. During my PhD I studied the underlying mechanisms of these microbial interactions via volatiles in soil, and then moved to studying microbial volatile interactions in the plant [holobiont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holobiont#:~:text=A%20holobiont%20is%20an%20assemblage,all%20bionts%20is%20the%20hologenome.). The holobiont can be described as an inseparable unit of the plant and its associated microbes, also called the microbiota. I am now looking at ways by which microbes help crops adapt to climate change stressors like drought. The goal of my research is to help find sustainable solutions for climate change issues in agriculture and beyond.
