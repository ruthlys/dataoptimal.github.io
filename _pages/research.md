I am intrigued by the how microbes interact and communicate with each other and their environment via gaseous compounds or volatiles. These compounds are called volatile because they are released into the air by microbes or plants and are perceived by a variety of organisms, including us humans. You may have heard of geosmin, the probably most famous volatile compound that has a characteristic earthy, fresh smell and is produced by soil-dwelling bacteria when rain hits dry soil.

These volatiles have a variety of interesting functions, like protecting plants from enemies and acting as a kind of language between separated microbes in soil. I've been studying these microbial interactions via volatiles in soil, and moved to studying microbial volatile interactions in the plant holobiont, which can be described as an inseparable unit of the plant and its associated microbes, also called the microbiota. I am now studying mechanisms by which microbes help crops adapt to climate change stressors, like drought. This will hopefully help finding ways to support sustainable agriculture practices in a changing climate.
